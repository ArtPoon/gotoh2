# gotoh2
Python/C module for pairwise alignment of genetic sequences using the Gotoh pairwise alignment algorithm.

This is just a sort of hobby-coding project that I started to keep my C coding skills up (since I do everything in Python these days) 
and to really get my head around pairwise alignment algorithms.
